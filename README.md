Welcome to the README.MD For my Tic-Tac-Toe Game.

Introduction:

This program creates a simple tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript and CSS. In particular,
it utilizes the React framework in order to manipulate my components, props, and states.
This variance of OOP allows for an extremely malleable program that serves to pass around
a multitude of variables that hold the values of corresponding states.

How to Play:

In order to run the program must first clone the repository into your IDE. Once the project
is opened you will want to open your command prompt.

1. In order to run the program must first clone the repository into your IDE.
2. Once the project is opened you will want to open your command prompt.
3. At the command prompt you need to input "cd my-app" which will change the directory to the application
4. at the command prompt type "npm start". This will build the program.
5. It will then open a host site with the corresponding tic-tac-toe game.
6. Each player will take turns plotting their moves until a winner has been decided, or a draw is reached.
7. In order to play again input, "ctrl + c" and it will prompt you to terminate the program and select "y"
8. Once you're back at the command prompt simply go back to step 4 and repeat.


Future Updates:
In the coming future I'd like to implement a score board that keeps track of the score between two players
as they play multiple games. With my limited knowledge of JS and CSS I was unable to complete this in time
but look forward to learning more as I further my understanding of these coding languages!

Reflection:
Learning to use react was an exciting challenge for me. Understanding this framework, much like others out there,
is crucial for our use to know if we are to become skilled web developers. If I could go back and do this again,
I'd like to try writing it in Python creating a GUI which is something I'm not as proficient at as I'd like to be.
